I made a simple app which manages your grocery list (in reminders, so it syncs with reminders and uses reminders as the storage location for the grocery list).

I wrote it in swift, to learn swift, which has [gone quite well](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user:2908+[swift]) so far.

The only thing different from the reminders app is that whe you add a new grocery, your previous groceries are counted and shown you can can quickly add things you commonly need to buy at the grocery store.
